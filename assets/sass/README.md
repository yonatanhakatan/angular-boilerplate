# Sass Boilerplate

The sass section of this boilerplate is taken from Hugo Giraudel's sass boilerplate (https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) and modified slightly to add a few features that I deemed useful.


# Main file

The main file (usually labelled `main.scss`) should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.
